# crawler_salary_federal_worker
This crawler get salary information about a lot of federal workers in public governmente site. 
I have a precompiled list with names of federal workers in university federal of pelotas. I took this list in public repository and the date of this data is 2014, for little of anonymization. 
For now, i save this output in Json file, but nothing prevents that someone save in other database.
